# Trinetra.net — AI Legal Intelligence Engine

> Free Chrome extension that reads Terms & Conditions for you. AI-powered clause analysis with Indian law citations and blockchain evidence storage.

---

## How It Works

The extension sends T&C text to a cloud backend which uses **Groq's free LLaMA 3 AI** to classify each clause. Results appear in a sidebar within seconds. No Python needed on the user's device.

---

## Deploy the Backend (Free — 10 minutes)

### Step 1 — Get a Free Groq API Key

1. Go to **console.groq.com**
2. Sign up (free, no credit card)
3. Click **API Keys** → **Create API Key**
4. Copy the key — looks like `gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

### Step 2 — Deploy to Railway (Free)

1. Go to **railway.app** → Sign up with GitHub (free)
2. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. Select this repository
4. Railway will auto-detect and deploy

### Step 3 — Add the API Key

In Railway dashboard:
1. Click your project → **Variables**
2. Add: `GROQ_API_KEY` = `gsk_your_key_here`
3. Railway redeploys automatically

### Step 4 — Get your live URL

Railway gives you a URL like:
```
https://trinetra-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

That's your live API. Open `/health` to confirm it's running.
